## **Current Challenges**

Before discussing our research, let's examine the severity of current ecological and energy crises.

### Ecological Crisis

When the Greenland ice sheet disintegrates at 7,600 tons per second, when 80% of the Maldives' territory is being infiltrated by Indian Ocean saltwater; when Australian bushfires release more CO₂ in a single day than 116 countries' annual emissions combined, when the Sahara Desert expands at a rate of 3 football fields per minute—Earth is experiencing its most dramatic ecological restructuring in geological history.

The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report warns with 0.01°C precision: the current warming trajectory will result in 50% of terrestrial species losing their habitats by the end of this century, while the potential release of 1,650 billion tons of CO₂ stored in Arctic permafrost could trigger irreversible climate changes.

### Energy Dilemma

Meanwhile, the collapse of the energy system is creating a dual humanitarian disaster: in Yemen, oil lamp smoke causes pneumonia rates of 67% among children under five; in Germany, the natural gas supply cut-off has put 43% of small and medium-sized enterprises on the brink of bankruptcy.

More absurdly, IEA data shows that the fossil fuels burned globally each year are equivalent to destroying 3.2 Amazon rainforests, yet 1.2 billion people still live in the dark cycle of "power generation equals emissions."

### Global Crisis and Alarm Upgrade

The scientific community's alarm has escalated to a red alert for the survival of civilization: the latest IPCC model shows that if current emissions are maintained, sea levels will rise by 15.4 meters by 2300, erasing 5,000 years of human coastal civilization; IEA estimates that the economic recession caused by the energy crisis in 2050 will result in a global GDP loss of $23 trillion.

At this critical juncture, the energy revolution is no longer just a technical proposition but a must-answer question for species continuation.

## **Renewable Energy and Storage Demand**

In the context of increasing global reliance on renewable energy, large-scale, long-duration energy storage has become a key support. By 2050, the share of renewable energy in global electricity supply is expected to increase from 42% in 2023 to 90%, with generation increasing sevenfold compared to 2023. However, the intermittency and volatility of renewable energy pose severe challenges to grid security and stability.

For example, in China, the storage demand is expected to reach 4,369 GWh to 6,128 GWh by 2060, while the total installed storage capacity was only 334.8 GWh in 2023, indicating a significant gap.

### Limitations of Traditional Storage Technologies

- **Pumped Hydro Storage**  
  As one of the main forms of large-scale storage, pumped hydro storage requires suitable water sources and high-difference sites. However, with the gradual reduction of available geographical conditions, its development space is becoming increasingly limited. The site selection requirements also make project construction cycles long and initial investments high, making it difficult to keep up with the speed of renewable energy installations.

- **Compressed Air Energy Storage**  
  Relying on natural or artificial storage cavities to accommodate large amounts of compressed air, its large-scale application depends on suitable storage cavities. However, in practical applications, it inevitably faces heat loss issues, leading to limited cycle efficiency. In addition, the safety, geological adaptability, and long-duration storage mode of storage cavities still require in-depth research and practical verification.

- **Hydrogen Storage**  
  Although considered an important carrier of clean energy, its power-to-power efficiency is still low. Large-scale hydrogen production, transportation, and storage face technical and safety challenges that need to be resolved. The construction and operation costs of related facilities are still high, and its application in power system storage still faces obstacles.

- **Lithium-ion Battery Storage**  
  Although lithium-ion batteries have been widely used in distributed and short-term storage fields, potential risks in resource supply, environmental pollution during production and disposal, and safety and lifespan requirements in large-scale management limit their use in large-scale, long-duration storage. They still cannot fully meet the needs of grid peak shaving and cross-seasonal storage.

## **Gravity Energy Storage: Solving Future Storage Dilemmas**

Gravity energy storage technology, as a frontier direction in the field of large-scale long-duration energy storage (LDES), is breaking through the technical dilemmas of geographical limitations of pumped hydro storage and resource constraints of electrochemical storage with its inherent safety, environmental friendliness, large-scale storage capability, long lifespan, and low cost.

Compared to the thermal runaway risk of lithium battery storage and the rare metal dependence of vanadium flow batteries, gravity energy storage achieves efficient conversion of mechanical potential energy to electrical energy, enabling minute-level response to wind and photovoltaic power fluctuations and cross-seasonal energy shifting. This provides key technical support for new power systems with high renewable energy penetration. In recent years, multiple companies and institutions have verified its technical reliability and economic feasibility and established several pilot projects.

Facing the rigid constraints of Earth's ecological carrying capacity, we choose to solve the storage dilemma with the most fundamental physical laws. Gravity energy storage technology, through the natural adaptability of geological structures, achieves GWh-level energy storage while minimizing interference with fragile ecosystems.

- **Northwest Gobi Wind and Solar Base**: It acts as an "energy regulator" to absorb tens of millions of kilowatts of green electricity;  
- **Resource-depleted Cities in North China**: Transforming abandoned mines into natural storage bodies, giving new life to underground tunnels;  
- **Eastern Coastal Industrial Belt**: Using construction waste and retired wind turbine blades as gravity potential energy carriers, opening up new ideas for the circular economy.

By continuously breaking through system efficiency limits and economies of scale, we ultimately provide a Chinese solution that combines environmental friendliness and engineering universality for global energy transition.
