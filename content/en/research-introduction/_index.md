## Main Research Directions

Our research focuses on the following core directions, each developed from theoretical research, technical breakthroughs, and engineering demonstrations:

- [**Power Plant Operation Control and Configuration Optimization**]({{< relref "direction-1" >}})  
  Explore dynamic response and control strategies of energy storage power plants under multiple operating conditions, optimize frequency regulation, power balance, and emergency response to ensure system stability under normal and fault conditions.

- [**Hybrid Energy Storage System Design**]({{< relref "direction-2" >}})  
  Integrate advantages of gravity storage with other forms (such as thermal, chemical energy), optimize multi-energy flow coupling strategies through mathematical modeling and simulation to improve overall system performance and economic benefits.

- [**Gravity Storage Potential and Comprehensive Benefit Assessment**]({{< relref "direction-3" >}})  
  Build multi-factor coupling evaluation models, systematically quantify economics, carbon reduction, and environmental benefits to provide scientific basis and decision support for large-scale storage project promotion.

- [**Intelligent Technology Applications**]({{< relref "direction-4" >}})  
  Combine AI, big data, and machine learning technologies to develop self-learning, fault prevention, and adaptive scheduling systems, enhancing intelligence level and operational efficiency of storage systems.
