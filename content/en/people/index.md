      title: Gravity Energy Storage Research Group
      text: |
        The Gravity Energy Storage Research Group, affiliated with the **State Key Laboratory of New Energy Power Systems** at North China Electric Power University, is a specialized research team in the field of gravity energy storage. We focus on developing theoretical methods, key technologies, demonstration platforms, and equipment R&D to address the major demands of large-scale renewable energy integration, particularly wind and solar power.

        Our research work has received long-term support from the **National Natural Science Foundation, Provincial and Ministerial Science and Technology Projects**, university key projects, and numerous leading energy and power enterprises. Our research areas encompass large-scale renewable energy integration and energy storage scheduling, gravity storage system design adaptable to various geographical environments, energy storage applications in abandoned mines and urban underground spaces, and intelligent operation and optimization control of storage systems. We strive to provide cutting-edge solutions for building new power systems and achieving **carbon neutrality** goals.
