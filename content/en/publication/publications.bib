	abstract = {The transportation sector is going through a rapid transition to electric vehicles to minimize our reliance on fossil fuels and reduce CO2 emissions. This is also happening in the cargo transport sector, with a rapid deployment of electric trucks. This paper proposes that the replacement of diesel trucks with electric trucks should first happen on routes where cargo is delivered from a location with a higher altitude to a location with a lower altitude. This way, the regenerative braking system of the truck can completely recharge the truck's battery. This paper investigates scenarios where electric trucks could operate indefinitely without grid electricity to charge their batteries. This concept was named perpetual motion electric truck (PMET). Results show that with an average road slope of 5 \%, 60 km/h speed, the weight of the cargo should be at least 1.32 times the weight of the truck, PMET can be achieved. PMET is an interesting alternative to reduce electricity demand and increase the sustainability of the transport sector.},

	abstract = {Hybrid energy storage is an interesting trend in energy storage technology. In this paper, we propose a hybrid solid gravity energy storage system (HGES), which realizes the complementary advantages of energy-based energy storage (gravity energy storage) and power-based energy storage (e.g., supercapacitor) and has a promising future application. First, we investigate various possible system structure schemes for the proposed HGES. In particular, we also obtained two superior system structure approaches through comparative analysis for two typical application scenarios, distribution and transmission grids. Subsequently, we theoretically analyze and mathematically model the energy conversion relationship of HGES based on different subsystems. More specifically, we discuss the control strategies of HGES in detail at three levels: power electronics, single-type energy storage system, and hybrid energy storage system. In addition, we propose complementary capacity configuration schemes for power-based energy storage systems based on the control strategies. Finally, the proposed HGES structures, control strategies, and capacity configuration schemes for distribution and transmission grid scale are simulated and verified based on MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that the proposed hybrid energy storage system has the advantages of both energy-based and power-based energy storage, which significantly improved compared to single energy storage technologies.},

	abstract = {Large-scale energy storage technology is crucial to maintaining a high-proportion renewable energy power system stability and addressing the energy crisis and environmental problems. Solid gravity energy storage technology (SGES) is a promising mechanical energy storage technology suitable for large-scale applications. However, no systematic summary of this technology research and application progress has been seen. Therefore, the basic concept of SGES and conducted a bibliometric study between 2010 and 2021 is first introduced to show SGES technology's evolution and predict future trends. Various SGES technologies have been intensively investigated in equipment, principles, materials, progress, and mathematical models. Furthermore, the key equipment's impact on SGES is discussed, and a systematical classification of SGES's different technical routes is conducted. Based on the technical characteristics, the advantages and disadvantages of SGES's different technical routes are discussed through their comparison. The decision tree is made for different technical route selections to facilitate engineering applications. Moreover, this paper also proposed the evaluation method of large-scale energy storage technology and conducted a comparative analysis of solid gravity energy storage with other large-scale energy storage technologies. Compared with other large-scale energy storage technologies, SGES has many advantages: high cycle efficiency (80 \%–90 \%), large energy storage capacity (up to several GWh), good geographical adaptability, and economy. Finally, the SGES's possible application scenarios and market scale assessment are presented based on SWOT analysis.},

	abstract = {Low-carbon energy transitions taking place worldwide are primarily driven by the integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. These variable renewable energy (VRE) sources require energy storage options to match energy demand reliably at different time scales. This article suggests using a gravitational-based energy storage method by making use of decommissioned underground mines as storage reservoirs, using a vertical shaft and electric motor/generators for lifting and dumping large volumes of sand. The proposed technology, called Underground Gravity Energy Storage (UGES), can discharge electricity by lowering large volumes of sand into an underground mine through the mine shaft. When there is excess electrical energy in the grid, UGES can store electricity by elevating sand from the mine and depositing it in upper storage sites on top of the mine. Unlike battery energy storage, the energy storage medium of UGES is sand, which means the self-discharge rate of the system is zero, enabling ultra-long energy storage times. Furthermore, the use of sand as storage media alleviates any risk for contaminating underground water resources as opposed to an underground pumped hydro storage alternative. UGES offers weekly to pluriannual energy storage cycles with energy storage investment costs of about 1 to 10 USD/kWh. The technology is estimated to have a global energy storage potential of 7 to 70 TWh and can support sustainable development, mainly by providing seasonal energy storage services.},

Compared with a single giant block, gravity energy storage technology based on several modular blocks (M-GES) has various advantages (such as easy standardization, mass production, and easy expansion), and is receiving increasingly widespread attention. However, there is a lack of research on its energy control. This paper systematically studies the energy management system (EMS) of M-GES plants. We establish a general M-GES state-of-charge model for the first time and propose the maximum height difference control (MHC) for EMS. To validate the effectiveness of the MHC, we use sinusoidal test power and a natural California load curve in MATLAB/Simulink. Finally, we summarize the characteristics of the proposed control strategies in conclusion and provide a guideline for further research.},

	abstract = {The global shift toward a sustainable and eco‐friendly energy landscape necessitates the adoption of long‐term, high‐capacity energy storage solutions. This research introduces an inventive energy storage concept involving the movement of granular materials from a lower elevation to a higher point within natural terrains such as mountains or excavated mining sites. Electrical energy is employed to charge electric batteries that elevate the granular material, thereby storing potential energy. Subsequently, this material is transported down during the electricity generation phase, and the regenerative braking mechanism converts the gravitational energy to replenish the vehicle's battery. The stored energy within these vehicles is then dispatched during peak demand periods or utilized by the vehicles for other freight transportation purposes. Our findings demonstrate a power cost of 1200 USD/kW, an energy storage expense spanning from 1 to 10 USD/kWh, a levelized cost of storage ranging from 35 to 200 USD/MWh, and a global annual potential of approximately 5.4 PWh. Electric vehicle gravity energy storage showcases its capability to bolster sustainable development by offering seasonal and multi‐year energy storage services.},

This study introduces innovative capacity configuration strategies for M-GES plants, namely Equal Capacity Configuration (EC) and Double-Rate Capacity Configuration (DR), tailored to optimize energy storage efficiency and stability. Through comprehensive MATLAB/Simulink simulations, we demonstrate each configuration's distinct power characteristics and operational advantages. Our findings reveal that while the EC configuration offers enhanced power accuracy and stability, it requires a larger number of units. In contrast, the DR configuration, characterized by fewer but larger units, shows a trade-off with reduced power stability. This paper contributes significantly to the field by presenting a first-of-its-kind comparative analysis of these configurations, offering insights into their practical applications and scalability.

	abstract = {This paper presents the first systematic study on power control strategies for Modular-Gravity Energy Storage (M-GES), a novel, high-performance, large-scale energy storage technology with significant research and application potential. Addressing the current research gap in M-GES power control technology, we propose two corresponding compensation modes and several power control strategies for Hybrid M-GES and M-GES. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform, including tests using sinusoidal power and feasibility verification based on a natural California load curve. Additionally, we analyze the normal and abnormal operating conditions of M-GES. In conclusion, the characteristics of the proposed control strategies are summarized, providing a guideline for further research.},

	abstract = {The large-scale integration of intermittent renewable energy sources poses significant challenges to grid flexibility and stability. Gravity energy storage offers a viable solution for high-capacity, long-duration, and economical energy storage. Modular gravity energy storage (M-GES) represents a promising branch of this technology; however, the lack of research on unit capacity configuration hinders its widespread adoption. This paper presents a pioneering investigation into the optimal capacity configuration of the motor system in M-GES power plants, which is crucial for stable operation and cost efficiency. We introduce a hybrid capacity optimization strategy that combines equal capacity configuration (EC) and double-rate capacity configuration (DR). Using the MATLAB/Simulink platform, we validate the power characteristics of the M-GES power plant under this new strategy, demonstrating that the power deviation remains within 0.1 \%. Notably, the Hybrid configuration can reduce the total cost of the motor system by 50 \% to 80 \% compared to the traditional EC approach. This research provides significant insights to support the commercialization of M-GES technology.},
