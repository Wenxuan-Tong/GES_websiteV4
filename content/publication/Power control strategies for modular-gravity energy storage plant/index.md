abstract: "This paper presents the first systematic study on power control strategies for Modular-Gravity Energy Storage (M-GES), a novel, high-performance, large-scale energy storage technology with significant research and application potential. Addressing the current research gap in M-GES power control technology, we propose two corresponding compensation modes and several power control strategies for Hybrid M-GES and M-GES. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform, including tests using sinusoidal power and feasibility verification based on a natural California load curve. Additionally, we analyze the normal and abnormal operating conditions of M-GES. In conclusion, the characteristics of the proposed control strategies are summarized, providing a guideline for further research."
